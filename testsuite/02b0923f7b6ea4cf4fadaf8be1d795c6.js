    super

    ...
    4. Let closure be FunctionCreate(Arrow, parameters, ConciseBody, scope, strict).
    ...

    The non-normative note elaborates on the "scope" argument:

    An ArrowFunction does not define local bindings for arguments, super, this, or new.target. Any reference to arguments, super, or this within an ArrowFunction must resolve to a binding in a lexically enclosing environment. Typically this will be the Function Environment of an immediately enclosing function. Even though an ArrowFunction may contain references to super, the function object created in step 4 is not made into a method by performing MakeMethod. An ArrowFunction that references super is always contained within a non-ArrowFunction and the necessary state to implement super is accessible via the scope that is captured by the function object of the ArrowFunction.
